# Create STAC catalogs

We have explored the following strategies to search for the Sentinel-2 tiles and save the metadata results as STAC catalogs:

* Using the [Earth Search STAC endpoint](https://www.element84.com/earth-search/) (see the [earth-search directory](./earth-search)), which offers access to Open Data collections available on AWS. Querying the STAC API resurns the metadata (already in STAC format). However, access to Sentinel-2 Level 1C data has been first restricted as to requester-pays, and the collection does not seem to be updated with new items after spring 2021. We make use of the scene classification map that comes with the Sentinel-2 Level 2A data.  
* Using metadata from the [Copernicus Open Access Hub API](https://scihub.copernicus.eu), linking assets to [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/public-datasets/sentinel-2) (GCS) (see the [copernicus-hub directory](./copernicus-hub)). Metadata needs to be saved into STAC format, but this solution seems more sustainable in not being dependent on the maintenance of the Earth Search STAC endpoint.
